Set aside to cool to room temperature","Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; set aside","In a large mixing bowl, beat together the eggs and sour cream","Add the stout-cocoa mixture, mixing to combine","Add the flour mixture and mix together at slow speed. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, and mix again for 1 minute","Divide the batter equally among the prepared pans. (The recipe yields about 10 cups or 2625g of batter. If you're making a double-layer cake, each pan should have about 5 cups or roughly 1312g. If you're making a triple-layer cake, each pan should have about 3 1/3 cups of batter or 875g). , Bake the layers for 40 to 45 minutes for 8\" pans, or 55 to 60 minutes for 9\" pans, until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove the cakes from the oven and cool on a rack for 10 minutes before turning the cakes out of their pans and returning to the rack to finish cooling completely before frosting","To make the frosting: Place the chopped chocolate in a large heatproof bowl. Bring the cream to a simmer in a heavy, medium-sized saucepan","Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and stir until the mixture is completely smooth","Stir in the vanilla. Refrigerate until the icing is spreadable, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours","To assemble: Trim the top of the cake layers to be level, if necessary (otherwise the layers will crack when they are stacked)","Line the edges of a serving plate with parchment or waxed paper to keep it clean, and then place the layer upside down on top. Spread 2/3 cup of the icing over just the top of the layer","Top with another cake layer, top side down, and repeat the process. If you baked three layers, add that one also","Use the remaining frosting to cover the top and sides of the cake. Remove the parchment or waxed paper.

The spice-timid can lower the amount of gochujang, the Korean red-pepper paste, and heat seekers should feel free to add more to taste at the end. Canned white beans and dark-green Tuscan kale (also called lacinato or dinosaur kale), stewed with soy sauce and honey, create a deeply savory flavor that is reminiscent of South Korean gochujang jjigae, a camping favorite starring pantry staples, and dakdori tang, a gochujang-based chicken and potato stew.","totalTime":"1 hour","totalTimeOriginalFormat":"PT1H","recipeYield":"4 servings","recipeIngredients":["2 tablespoons unsalted butter or olive oil","1 large red onion, coarsely chopped","Salt and black pepper","5 large garlic cloves, coarsely chopped","3 tablespoons gochujang, plus more to taste","3 cups vegetable broth","2 tablespoons soy sauce","1 teaspoon honey or dark brown sugar","1 pound baby gold or fingerling potatoes, large ones halved","1 (15-ounce) can cannellini or butter beans, rinsed","1 large bunch Tuscan kale, stems and leaves chopped (6 packed cups)","Cooked white rice, for serving","Sour cream and chopped flat-leaf parsley (both optional), for serving"],"recipeInstructions":["Heat a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high. Melt the butter and add the onion. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion starts to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and gochujang, and stir until heated through and fragrant, just a few seconds.","Stir in the vegetable broth, soy sauce, honey, potatoes and beans. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over high, then reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle boil. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, then add the kale. (It will seem like a lot at first but will wilt down considerably.) Tamping down the kale, continue gently boiling the covered stew, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are tender and the broth is thickened to your liking, 10 to 20 minutes. Taste the broth and add more salt, pepper and gochujang as desired.","Serve the stew alongside white rice and, for coolness against the heat, top with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of parsley, if using."],"recipeCategories":["dinner","easy","lunch","weeknight","main course"],"recipeCuisines":["korean"],"keywords":["cannellini bean","fingerling potato","gochujang","kale","lima bean","new potato","vegetarian"],"url":"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1024082-gochujang-potato-stew"}}
