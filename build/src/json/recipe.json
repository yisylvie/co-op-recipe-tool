The spice-timid can lower the amount of gochujang, the Korean red-pepper paste, and heat seekers should feel free to add more to taste at the end. Canned white beans and dark-green Tuscan kale (also called lacinato or dinosaur kale), stewed with soy sauce and honey, create a deeply savory flavor that is reminiscent of South Korean gochujang jjigae, a camping favorite starring pantry staples, and dakdori tang, a gochujang-based chicken and potato stew.","totalTime":"1 hour","totalTimeOriginalFormat":"PT1H","recipeYield":"4 servings","recipeIngredients":["2 tablespoons unsalted butter or olive oil","1 large red onion, coarsely chopped","Salt and black pepper","5 large garlic cloves, coarsely chopped","3 tablespoons gochujang, plus more to taste","3 cups vegetable broth","2 tablespoons soy sauce","1 teaspoon honey or dark brown sugar","1 pound baby gold or fingerling potatoes, large ones halved","1 (15-ounce) can cannellini or butter beans, rinsed","1 large bunch Tuscan kale, stems and leaves chopped (6 packed cups)","Cooked white rice, for serving","Sour cream and chopped flat-leaf parsley (both optional), for serving"],"recipeInstructions":["Heat a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high. Melt the butter and add the onion. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion starts to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and gochujang, and stir until heated through and fragrant, just a few seconds.","Stir in the vegetable broth, soy sauce, honey, potatoes and beans. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over high, then reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle boil. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, then add the kale. (It will seem like a lot at first but will wilt down considerably.) Tamping down the kale, continue gently boiling the covered stew, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are tender and the broth is thickened to your liking, 10 to 20 minutes. Taste the broth and add more salt, pepper and gochujang as desired.","Serve the stew alongside white rice and, for coolness against the heat, top with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of parsley, if using."],"recipeCategories":["dinner","easy","lunch","weeknight","main course"],"recipeCuisines":["korean"],"keywords":["cannellini bean","fingerling potato","gochujang","kale","lima bean","new potato","vegetarian"],"url":"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1024082-gochujang-potato-stew"},"fca86ee0-e716-4eb6-b3d0-5dcd65320bec":{"name":"Baked Ziti","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2014/7/2/0/WU0701_Baked-Ziti_s4x3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.406.406.suffix/1404907001836.jpeg","height":"406","width":"406"},"description":"With over 500 five-star reviews, the Pioneer Woman's Baked Ziti recipe is a hearty crowd-pleaser that's so easy to make.","cookTime":"30 minutes","cookTimeOriginalFormat":"P0Y0M0DT0H30M0.000S","totalTime":"1 hour 35 minutes","totalTimeOriginalFormat":"P0Y0M0DT1H35M0.000S","recipeYield":"12 servings","recipeIngredients":["2 tablespoons olive oil","3 cloves garlic, minced","1 large onion, diced","1 pound ground beef","1 pound Italian sausage","Two 14.5-ounce cans tomato sauce or marinara sauce","One 28-ounce can whole tomatoes with juice","2 teaspoons Italian seasoning","1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes","Salt and freshly ground black pepper","1 pound ziti","1 1/2 pounds mozzarella, grated","One 15-ounce tub whole-milk ricotta","1/2 cup grated Parmesan","2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, plus more for sprinkling","2 eggs"],"recipeInstructions":["Heat the olive oil in a pot over medium heat.

The presence of the stout gives the cake a complex finish and the slightly bitter hops from the beer act as a counterpoint to the sugar in the cake. It's an incredibly moist cake, too, and its rich, dark color comes mostly from the beer. Thanks to Barrington Brewery & Restaurant in Great Barrington, MA for the inspiration for this recipe. The Chocolate Stout Cake was one of our Bake of the Week recipes for March 2023.","cookTime":"1 hour","cookTimeOriginalFormat":"PT1H0M","prepTime":"25 minutes","prepTimeOriginalFormat":"PT25M","totalTime":"3 hours 30 minutes","totalTimeOriginalFormat":"PT3H30M","recipeYield":"16","recipeIngredients":["2 cups (454g) stout or dark beer such as Guinness","32 tablespoons (454g) unsalted butter cold","1 1/2 cups (128g) Dutch-process cocoa","4 cups (480g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour","4 cups (794g) granulated sugar","1 tablespoon baking powder","1 1/2 teaspoons salt*","4 large eggs at room temperature","3/4 cup (170g) sour cream at room temperature","2 2/3 cups (454g) bittersweet chocolate wafers or semisweet chocolate wafers chopped*","2 cups (454g) heavy cream","1 teaspoon King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract"],"recipeInstructions":["Preheat the oven to 350°F.
